**notes

For this assessment, write a program uses OO in Ruby, using at least 2 classes. You can make up your own idea of something to build, or you can work on an exercise from the past section that you didn't get to earlier.

The evaluation criteria are almost the same as from the OO in JavaScript week:

Does your code continue to meet all of the standards from last week?
Did you use objects to drive your application logic?
Did you use an array as a property of one class that contained objects of the other class?
Did you use class methods and variables appropriately?
